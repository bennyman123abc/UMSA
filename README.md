## Contributing
All contributions and constructive criticism towards this project is completely welcome! That being said, a suggestion may not always be accepted, or if it steers to far from the original objective of the project, it may be split into another branch of the project (Ex. A CraftBukkit supporting archetype).

Contributions of any kind **(Whether you have write access to the main repository or not)** should ***ALWAYS*** be in the form of a pull request to a new, or existing branch aside from Master.
